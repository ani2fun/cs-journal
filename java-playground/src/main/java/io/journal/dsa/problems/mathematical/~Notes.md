# Arithmetic and Geometric Progressions.

Arithmetic:

```
2,   4,  6,  8,  10 ....
a=2, d=2, a+d, a+2d, a+(n-1)d ....
avg = sum / n
sum = avg * n
    = ( ( FT + LT ) / 2 ) * n       // FT = First term , LT = Last term
    = (n/2) (a + a+(n-1)d)
    = n/2 (2a + (n-1)d )
```

Geometric:

```
 2,        4,      8,      16,         34,         ...
 r=2, a.r(pow(1)) , a.r(pow(2)) , a.r(pow(3)) ..... , a.r(pow(n-1))
 = a( 1 - r.pow(n)) / (1 - r)
```

# Prime Numbers

A Number which is only divisible by 1 or itself.

e.g. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11

Some facts about prime:

- Two and three are only consecutive natural numbers which are prime too.
- Every prime number can be represented in the form of (6n+1) or (6n-1) except 2 and 3, where n is natural number.
